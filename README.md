Learn-OCaml
===========

This is Learn OCaml, a Web platform for learning the OCaml language,
featuring a Web toplevel, an exercise environment, and a directory of
lessons and tutorials.

This software is still under development, no public announcement has been made yet.

A demo is available at: [http://try.ocamlpro.com/learn-ocaml-demo/].

The exercises and lessons are in another github repository:
[learn-ocaml-repository](https://github.com/OCamlPro/learn-ocaml-repository).

How to compile and try
----------------------

Note: you need a working ```opam``` environment with OCaml ```4.05.0```.

* Install the dependencies using:
  - if you have opam >=2.0 available: `opam switch create . --deps && eval $(opam env)`
  - otherwise: `make build-deps` (You may want to first read the script
    `install-opam-deps.sh` to know what it does.)

* Compile the app using:
```
make
```

You can customise the exercise repository and output directory using
make variables ```REPO_DIR``` and ```DEST_DIR```. By default, the
repository used is an included demo repository. The user contributed
exercises of the public platform is in the github
[learn-ocaml-repository](https://github.com/OCamlPro/learn-ocaml-repository)
repository. An example configuration is

```
make REPO_DIR=../learn-ocaml-repository DEST_DIR=$HOME/public_html/learn-ocaml
```

* Then either put the resulting directory ```www/``` behind a Web server.

Either this step or the next is mandatory. Indeed, if you try to open
the ```index.html``` file directly from the local file system, it will
fail for security restrictions enforced by modern Web browsers. Hence,
you need a local web server.

* If you do not have a Web server configured, you can probably use some
  other tool that is already present on your machine. For instance,
  running ```python3 -m http.server 9090``` or ```php -S
  localhost:9090``` in the ```www``` directory and pointing you browser
  to ```http://localhost:9090/``` should do the job.

* Or alternatively, use the provided minimal server, that also does the job,
  and includes a minimal server-side synchronization mechanism.

You can launch it via

```
./learnocaml-simple-server.byte
```

A Docker container can also be generated using this minimal server, via the provided
script:
```
bash scripts/build-docker-image.sh -repo-dir ../learn-ocaml-repository
```

This generates an image named ```learnocaml-docker``` (by default, but it can be
renamed using the option ```-image-name <my_image>```).

The server can then be launched using a wrapper around docker CLI:

```
bash scripts/docker-server.sh init
```

The same command with the argument ```stop``` will kill the
server. After the first initialization, the server can be restarted
using ```start```. Finally, be aware that the ```remove``` command
removes the container from the docker system. As such, it will remove
every saved sessions from the ```sync``` directory, __i.e.__ every
saved users' code. For this reason, this command also needs a `.tar`
argument that will contain a backup of these files.

As a reminder, the Docker deamon's socket is owned by default by
`root`. Hence, these scripts cannot work without ```sudo``` or adding
your current user to the group ```docker```. For more information, see
[post installation steps for
Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) from
the documentation. However, be advised there exists security flaws in
the Docker daemon (see
[documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface)).
